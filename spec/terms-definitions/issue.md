[[def: issue, Issue, Issues, issues]]

~ GitHub.com issues. Anyone who want or needs the track issues needs to have a Github.com (free) account.

~ Issues are the KERICONF way to:
~ - assign work to [[ref: roles]]
~ - track the progress and status with regards to objectives and milestones
~ - have a single point of definition of deliverables.

~ More info:  After *getting* a Github.com (free) user account, it needs to shared with the administrator of the KERICONFYY repo. He/she *invites* the user and then the user has to *accept* the invitation. Only then a new user can follow the issue tracking.
