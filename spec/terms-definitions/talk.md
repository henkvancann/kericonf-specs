[[def: talk, Talk]]

~ A (possible) contribution of a [[ref: Speaker]] that the organization has planned, settled or confirmed.

~ - Note: A Talk is not the same as a [[ref:Session]]. There can be more than one Speaker featured for a certain [[ref:Topic]], so that there can be more than one Talk planned, but only just one unique [[ref:Session]] settled for a possible set of Talks around a Topic.
