[[def: reception-area, Reception Area, Reception Areas]]

~ An designated area in or at the entrance of the [[ref: Venue]] where registration, reception and catering can take place, in a way that clear guidance is possible for the visitors of the KERICONF and no outsiders can participate in the event unseen.

~ More info: a loud and cold general entrance where we can't display our event, is not a reception area. Neither is a lunch area where outsiders can pick a plate and get a lunch for free.

~ Also see: [[ref: Rooms]].
