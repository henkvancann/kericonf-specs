[[def: role, Role, Roles, roles]]

~ A role is a formally function in the organization. Individuals can have more than one role. It's responsibility to perform task and get results described in [[ref: issues]]. 

~ Volunteers and paid officers both have an obligation to perform the roles and tasks they've committed to. There are only two points in time that voluntary work is optional: when one starts and when one finishes being a volunteer.
