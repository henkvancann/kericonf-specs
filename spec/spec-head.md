*A specification for organising the conference from early idea to afterwork*

## Intro

This is a default Spec-Up-T installation. Find information on the inner working of the specification tool Spec-Up-T on its [Documentation website](https://trustoverip.github.io/spec-up-t-website/).

The organization of a KERICONF is standardized off the bat. This means that for organizers, venue, suppliers, service-providers,  sponsor, speakers, and finally, the most important category, visitors, we have this document with a glossary so as to support a smooth development and execution path of the coming KERICONF and the aftermath.
